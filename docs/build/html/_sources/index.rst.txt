CFSpy Documentation
========================

Welcome to the documentation of the **CFSpy** Python package.

**CFSpy** is used for the computation of Chen-Fliess series
and their applications in control and reachability theory.
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using and contributing to the project.

It provides the following functionalities:

- The list of iterated integrals indexed by words of a certain length or less.
- The list of Lie derivatives indexed by words of a certain length or less.
- A single iterated integral indexed by a given word.
- A single Lie derivative indexed by a given word.
- The symbolic polinomial that represents the Chen-Fliess series for a constant input.
