# CFSpy

Welcome to the documentation of the CFSpy Python package.

CFSpy is used for the computation of Chen-Fliess series and their applications in control and reachability theory. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using and contributing to the project.

The package provides the following functionalities:

- The list of iterated integrals indexed by words of a certain length or less.
- The list of Lie derivatives indexed by words of a certain length or less.
- A single iterated integral indexed by a given word.
- A single Lie derivative indexed by a given word.
- The symbolic polynomial that represents the Chen-Fliess series for a constant input.

The implementation is based on Chen’s identity, which provides recursive relations between iterated integrals and Lie derivatives, significantly reducing redundant computation.

This package is the first publicly available open‑source implementation of these tools in the Python ecosystem, relying only on NumPy and SymPy for minimal and efficient dependencies.
